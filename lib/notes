 fitted box don't work with expanded or spacer
 fitted box try use it with scale down

you don't need to specify a height for horizntal list view use

wrap the list tile with center
ypu don't need to specify a width for list tile use intrinsic width

be careful while using intrinsic width,height at animations or builder widgets

  static init(BuildContext context) {
    height = MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).height;
    width = MediaQuery.sizeOf(context).width;
